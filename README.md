## Inspiration

Over the last 1.5 years since the pandemic began, we have seen an immense inclusion of social media in the running of our daily lives. A major reason for this is that as our lives became more and more restricted to the four walls of our homes, it became difficult for most people to find *safe spaces* to be themselves and social media provided so many voiceless people with the means and stage to express their thoughts and opinions.

So when I came across this hackathon, I felt that building a product that helps people keep a check on their emotional state and express it better on their preferred platforms would be a really fun idea. And that is exactly what I did!

## What it does

**Social Mojifier** emojifies your selfie based on your predominant emotion and allows you to save and share it on your social media handles with the rest of the world! It's a fun little app to share how you're feeling with whoever you would like to out there in a really cool way.

## How I built it

The technologies that I used to build this app are:

* **Xamarin.Forms**: to build a cross-platform app using C# (.NET) and XAML
* **Azure Cognitive Services Face API**: to analyse the emotions on the face of the user
* **Skia**: to add the emoji mapped to the predominant emotion on the user's face in their selfie
